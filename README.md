Developed a Python script to extract and analyze customer reviews for British Airways from an HTML website.
Utilized Python libraries including HotSoup, pandas, and requests for data scraping and manipulation.
Implemented a multi-step data processing pipeline involving:
Step 1: Text Cleaning: Removed extraneous characters, HTML tags, and symbols to standardize the text data.
Step 2: Tokenization: Divided the cleaned text into individual tokens for further analysis.
Step 3: Enrichment â€“ POS Tagging: Assigned grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb) to each token using Part-of-Speech tagging.
Step 4: Stopwords Removal: Eliminated common stopwords to focus on meaningful content.
Step 5: Obtaining Stem Words: Reduced words to their base forms using stemming techniques for linguistic analysis.
Employed matplotlib for data visualization, producing insightful graphs and charts to aid in analysis and decision-making.
